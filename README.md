## security
As presentation time flew by faster than anticipated, I realized the need to explain security measures in some detail here. It's important to note that storing the user as a complete object within local storage is not the most secure method. If this application were to be launched, I would recommend using Firebase and implementing Google Authenticator to enhance login security.

However, it's worth acknowledging that the convenience and accessibility of local storage make it a viable option for this project. Nonetheless, we should always prioritize the safety and protection of user information, and consider alternative options when you want to store user data.
